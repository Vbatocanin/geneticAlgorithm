## Introduction to the Genetic Algorithm

### Introduction

When faced with a very complex problem for which there isn't a definitive solution, we turn to **metaheuristics**. Metaheuristics are basically methods of finding the best search method for finding the optimal solution to a very complex problem. This may seem like a complicated concept, but think of it like this:

>  The **Genetic algorithm** is just a mold, and it's behavior is highly dependent on it's parameters. 
>
> Imagine only a single sorting algorithm exists, `superSort(String parameter)` , and we use it by specifying the type of sorting method we want to use by filling in the `parameter`. For example, if we want to use Merge Sort, we type in `superSort(MergeSort)` or if we want to get fired, we type in `superSort(BogoSort)`. This in turn is a **metaheuristic**.
